        • Tools - MySQL Workbench, VS Code / PyCharm, XAMPP or WAMP

• Installation and Setup :

        • Step 1: Clone the Repository
                git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/hospital-management-system.git
                cd hospital-management-system
        
        • Step 2: Install Dependencies
                pip install mysql-connector-python
        
        • Step 3: Configure the Database
                Open MySQL Workbench or your MySQL terminal.
                Create a new database:
                        CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
                        Import the SQL dump file (if available) or manually create the required tables.
                        Update the database connection details inside the Python script:
                        connection = mysql.connector.connect(
                            host="localhost",
                            user="root",
                            password="yourpassword",
                            database="hospital_db"
                        )
        
        • Step 4: Run the Application
                python hospital_management.py

• Database Schema :

        • patients – id, name, age, gender, address, contact
        • doctors – id, name, specialization, phone
        • appointments – id, patient_id, doctor_id, date, time
        • medicines – id, name, quantity, expiry_date
        • billing – id, patient_id, total_amount, payment_status

• Future Enhancements :

        • Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or React.
        • Integrate email or SMS notifications for appointments.

Include a dashboard for hospital analytics and reports.

Implement role-based access (Admin, Doctor, Receptionist).
